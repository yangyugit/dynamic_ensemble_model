# dynamic_ensemble_model
A novel dynamic ensemble model which is based on state-space approach

## environment: MATLAB
MATLAB is all you need to run this simulation to see the performance of the dynamic ensemble model based on state-space approach.

## code structure
The code is all in a single script named main.m. 
And the comments are added in some important lines to help you understand the code.
Note that the corresponding function is in the bottom of the script. 

## simulation results
The simulation results are presented in figures and performance.csv file which will be generated in the current file automatically.
